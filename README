Manage a webradio in a breeze; handle live shows, upload songs, broadcast shows as it should be âˆ’ simple and
reactive.

Created by actual showrunners from the now-closed french webradio [SynopsLive](http://www.synopslive.net/),
it is powering both live and recorded podcasts.

Technically, this is composed of multiple processes:

 - An Ember.js web application,
 - A Flask application which expose an API used by the Ember.js web application,
 - A simple run-loop,
 - A Liquidsoap backend, that do the actual audio generation and output an OGG/Vorbis and MP3-encoded feed,
 - An Icecast instance, to broadcast Liquidsoap generated audio feed around the Internet.
